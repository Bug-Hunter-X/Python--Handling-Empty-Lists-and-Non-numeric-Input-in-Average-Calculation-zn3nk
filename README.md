This repository contains example code demonstrating a common error in Python: failing to handle an empty list when calculating the average of a list of numbers. The initial code does not handle the edge case where the input list is empty, resulting in a `ZeroDivisionError`. The improved solution addresses this by explicitly checking if the list is empty before performing the calculation.  Furthermore, it addresses issues with non-numeric input and includes improved error handling.
